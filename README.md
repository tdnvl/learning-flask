# Learning Flask
An API-centric project to learn how to bring Python to the Web through Flask.

## Course

This project is based on the Lynda.com course of the same name: [Learning Flask](https://www.lynda.com/Flask-tutorials/Learning-Flask/521231-2.html).

## virtualenv

This project relies on [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to safely install and run Flask without compromising other libraries on my machine.

To start virtualenv, type in the root folder:

`$ virtualenv ENV`

To stop working in the virtual environment, type:

`$ deactivate`
